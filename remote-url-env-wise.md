To configure remote URLs environment-wise in Vite, particularly for Module Federation with vite-plugin-federation, you can leverage Vite's environment variable loading mechanism. This allows you to define different remote URLs for different environments (e.g., development, staging, production). 
Here's how you can achieve this: 

• Define Environment-Specific Remote URLs in .env files: 

Create separate .env files for each environment in your project's root directory. For example: .env.development. 
        VITE_REMOTE_APP_URL=http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js

.env.staging. 
        VITE_REMOTE_APP_URL=https://staging.yourdomain.com/remoteEntry.js

.env.production. 
        VITE_REMOTE_APP_URL=https://prod.yourdomain.com/remoteEntry.js

Vite automatically loads these files based on the mode it's running in (e.g., development, staging, production). Variables prefixed with VITE_ are exposed to your application code via import.meta.env. 

• Access Environment Variables in vite.config.js: 

In your vite.config.js, you can access these environment variables to dynamically configure your vite-plugin-federation remotes. You might need to use loadEnv if you need to access them directly within the config evaluation phase, or process.env if they are already available in the process environment. 
    import { defineConfig, loadEnv } from 'vite';
    import federation from '@originjs/vite-plugin-federation';

    export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => {
      const env = loadEnv(mode, process.cwd(), 'VITE_'); // Load env variables for the current mode

      return {
        plugins: [
          federation({
            name: 'host-app',
            remotes: {
              remoteApp: env.VITE_REMOTE_APP_URL, // Use the environment variable
            },
            shared: ['react', 'react-dom'],
          }),
        ],
      };
    });

Running Vite in Specific Modes. 
You can specify the mode when running your Vite commands in package.json scripts: development. 
        "scripts": {
          "dev": "vite --mode development"
        }

staging. 
        "scripts": {
          "build:staging": "vite build --mode staging"
        }

production. 
        "scripts": {
          "build:prod": "vite build --mode production"
        }

By following these steps, your Vite application will dynamically load the correct remote URL for your microfrontend based on the environment it's running in, ensuring flexibility and maintainability across different deployment stages.
